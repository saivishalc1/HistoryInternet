    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> Mark Andreesen was one of the first people to think of a way to release the web so everyone can use it. They added pictures audios and more for people to use. </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> Fall of 1993 they made mosaic for humanity. They posted an announcement into a news script, and it went from 10,10000,100000, etc. </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> James H. Clark was a poor boy who turned himself around to becoming an extraordinarily rich owner of silicon graphics. </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> Clark was trying to get something big and when he says Music, he knew that was it. He bet 1/3 of his net worth on it. </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> Microsoft for 2 decades was all about the computer industry, letting them have a firm grip of all things related to computers. </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> 1975 – Bill Gate’s career started where he dropped out of Harvard to start his company with his friend Paul Allen.  </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> 1993 – About 90% of PCS were running Microsoft windows. Microsoft became extremely wealthy, making the employee stock option millionaires. </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> Gates brought companies like lotus, novel, and even IDM to their knees. At one point Gates had as much power as the president. </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> In 1993 Bill Gates was going to become the world’s high-tech emperor. </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> Summer 1994 – Netscape communications was launched with Jim Clark and his team. It was at the time the fastest growing web. With Clark watching over the employees were spreading the news about the web. </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> Netscape completely dissed Microsoft, the company that was basically running the world at this point. </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> 13th of October 1994 – Navigator hit the streets. It was a runaway success. They had a million downloads very quick. </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> Netscape’s success was starting wipe off Microsoft, leading for Microsoft to raise some concerns. </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> 1995 - Internet was becoming the full scale phenom, and Netscape was the head of it. It was looking particularly good for Netscape at this point. </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> In 1997, 72% of the business was also owned by Netscape. But Internet Explorer 4.0 was released in October 1997 and browser war waves were modified. It pursued the released specifications of W3C faster and more loyally than Netscape Navigator 4.0. In browser battles, Microsoft has two key advantages. One was a matter of resources: Netscape began with almost 90% market share and a great deal of public goodwill, but it became financially fragile as a relatively small business which produced most of its profits from what was essentially one commodity. Gross sales of Netscape have never matched the cash-on-the-hand earnings of Microsoft. </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> The other, most significant, advantage was that Microsoft Windows has an industry lock that could be used to take over IE. IE arrived with every Windows clone and thus Microsoft somehow managed to grow market share even though IE's prior versions were marginally less than Netscape's browser. And IE remained free because Windows' huge sales helped to fund its development and promotion, leading to drastic updates to Netscape so close it could not be downloaded and installed. </li>
