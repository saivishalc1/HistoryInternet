    <p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;">Chad Hurley, Kevin Rose, and Jay Adelson were the leaders of the “Internet 2.0”. Hurley owns one of the biggest and largest social networking companies in the world, and that company is called Youtube, which was bought by Google in 2006 for around 1.6 billion dollors. Kevin Rose and Jay Adelson both run Digg. For Digg, it is the people that decide what becomes popular, whatever people “Digg” the most prevalent it becomes. Arthur Saltsburger, the founder of the New York times, believed that Zuckerbeg was smart but really lucky with the timing of Facebook. Next we see that in time of songs and music, we get to see the MP3. David Weekly, the founder of MP3 made it possible for people to be able to listen to multiple songs by allowing people to hold more songs by compressing the data. Back then, people had to get a disc for each new song and play,because of the big the file was. David Weekley was able to launch a MP3 information website, and just after 2 weeks, he was using about 85% of Stanford’s bandwidth. As more and more people were starting to share their music online without consideration of copyrights, the founder of Napster, Shawn Fanning got his idea, when he friend was going through the web to look through to find music songs and people had songs that some others were interested in, and this is what sparked his company. Napster allowed people to share their songs with others, meaning people that had an MP3, and typed in their song, they were able to download and listen to their music. Straight from their hard drive to yours. In June 1999 Fanning finished coding up the Napster, and shared it with a couple of people, but soon enough it became popular and was spread around many universities fast. It was found that what Napster was doing was illegal and had to filter out all the copyrighted songs and music fast. The only way they could filter out the music and songs was to see if it was a “Rolling Stone”. Many music creators were furious when finding out about Napster and what it could really do. They would be losing a lot of money from letting many others hear their songs and music for free.  On May 3 2000, Metallica came over to Napster with their lawyers to talk to them about not playing their songs to be played on Napster, and this was a big issue because there were around a couple hundred people waiting around the building smashing Metallica Cd’s.Soon after a lawsuit Napster was then soon shut down. This law-suit then became the start of many other sites like Youtube, getting suited for intellectual property. But for Youtube, their fears were not that great since they were no longer a small smartup and are now owned by Google. By the Summer of 2005,  MySpace, a website where people could hangout with one another with music in the background, became a big website where it soon had more website visits than even Google. The next thing became Facebook, the founder Mark Zuckerberg began with college student at first and it began to spread around a lot.Zuckerberg created and coded Facebook in the his dorm room, and then traveled to silicon valley, met with venture capitalists and was able quickly grow the website from college students to other people in different ages. Facebook allowed people to connect to others and communicate with and see what they are up. Facebook allowed people to connect to others that have the same interests and allowed them to talk to one another. Microsoft then bought 1.6 percent of Facebook for 240 million dollars. The creation of many more sites turning people into millionaires overnight are becoming greater, as more social networking has been greater. </p>
