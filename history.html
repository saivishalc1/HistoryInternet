<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> The internet is also a valuable place to get uncensored information through news, phones, and more. It was really a key in Kosovo crisis, that provided unfiltered information regarding the Balkan tragedy. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> Internet was developed in the 1950’s. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> The internet was the one of the greatest inventions to date, it was better then the automobile, the printing press, telephones and more. It was one of the forms of communications of that time. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> More emails are sent then first-class letters delivered then US post office, and in financial importance the internet create 3.1 billion dollars in business. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> The internet was responsible for 1/3 of the economic growth in 1998. li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> The seminal idea behind the internet was envisioned up of by a psychologist named J.C.R. Lickliter, who was a professor at Massachusetts institute of technology in the 1950s. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> Computers were portrayed as sci-fi props. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> People that the internet and computers was far more imaginative than anything Hollywood came up with. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> The first computers were the size of people’s rooms and were never intended to communicate. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> The technology for the standalone computers was possible for a long time but the frightening technological superiority in the soviets scared the United States. When the Russians launched sputnik president Eisenhower created ARPA. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> In MIT, a graduate student named Leonard Cline lock began to apply human theory into data transmission. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> He created two desperate ways to speed up the network by implementing two techniques the demand access net he distributed control. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> Leonard Cline lock allowed Lickliter’s theory to be a reality. It was the ah ha moment. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> Paul Bernard was hired to see if he could create an indestructible form of communication in fear of a nuclear war with the Soviets. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> The first computer stem was created by a person named Bob Taylor. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> ARPA funds research on the "cooperative network of time-sharing computers." /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> A new idea was going through early 1969 there was the thing called timesharing. Timesharing allowed a day long response into 2 seconds. Bob Taylor moved from computer to computer and tried to build a terminal. He wanted to build a way to connect all computers to one. /li>
<i style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> Paul Bernard got a million-dollar fund to build a terminal where every computer can link to one. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> Taylor recruited Larry Roberts. Roberts had created an experimental connection between two computers at MIT. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> Robert first idea to link the computers, which would be putting them in a chain, but this had a flaw. This would require the computer to process multiple algorithms and connect with other computers, which would be to much for the computer, but he had a better idea. Robert’s with the help of another engineer Robert’s idea of making special minicomputers to connect to each other. Now the computers only had to connect with one another software. On paper he had the network figured out, but no one wanted to build it at the time. The phone company had their own worries. 1968 was a mid-evil time. 1968 was the year the Robert’s had gone out searching for people to build his invention, known as the ARPAnet later to be known as the internet. Lawrence Roberts leads ARPAnet design discussions and publishes first ARPAnet design paper: "Multiple Computer Networks and Intercomputer Communication."  Wesley Clark suggests the network is managed by interconnected ‘Interface Message Processors’ in front of the major computers. Called IMPs, they evolve into today’s routers.  He placed Imp’s the processors are 4 different locations, 3 in California and one in Utah. He asked 140 companies to make a bid on his invention including big companies like AT&T and IDM. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> BBM was given the option to discover packet switching. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> On September 1, 1969 the first piece of hardware of the IMP was shipped to UCL and by the end of 1969 all the sites were connected, if this failed, they probably would have scrapped it. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> In April 1971 area had 18 different main frame computers to the network. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> Email was created by Anarchist and he created the @ sign. It was written by someone by himself. It was easy. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> In October 1973, Arpa turned science fiction into Science fact. /li>
<li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;">  Local area networks started popping up, the Internet start becoming a day to day use and a mandatory thing. li>
